Poli 281 Data in Politics: An Introduction  
-  In summer 2023, I worked with [Lucy Martin](https://sites.google.com/site/lucymartin/), [Timothy Ryan](https://timryan.web.unc.edu/), [Isabel Laterzo](https://isabellaterzo.com/), and Bryce Hecht on developing a cutting-edge undergraduate curriculum in quantitative social science for UNCâ€™s Political Science Department.
