## Curriculum Development

* **Poli 281 Data in Politics: An Introduction**
  * In summer 2023, I worked with [Lucy Martin](https://sites.google.com/site/lucymartin/), [Timothy Ryan](https://timryan.web.unc.edu/), [Isabel Laterzo](https://isabellaterzo.com/), and [Bryce Hecht](https://politicalscience.unc.edu/staff/bryce-hecht/) on developing a cutting-edge undergraduate curriculum in quantitative social science for UNCâ€™s Political Science Department. My main contributions included compiling new data sets, developing new homework assignments, and revamping existing teaching materials.
