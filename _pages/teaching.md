## Curriculum Development

* **Poli 281 Data in Politics: An Introduction**
  * In summer 2023, I worked with [Lucy Martin](https://sites.google.com/site/lucymartin/), [Timothy Ryan](https://timryan.web.unc.edu/), [Isabel Laterzo](https://isabellaterzo.com/), and [Bryce Hecht](https://sites.google.com/view/brycehecht/home) on developing a cutting-edge undergraduate curriculum in quantitative social science for UNC’s Political Science Department. My main contributions included compiling new data sets, developing new homework assignments, and revamping existing teaching materials.
