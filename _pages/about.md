I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/), where I specialize in Comparative Politics and Political Methodology. I am also a member of the [Authoritarian Politics Lab at UNC-Chapel Hill](https://tarheels.live/applab/) and the [Volfovsky Lab Group at Duke University](https://volfovsky.github.io/labgroup/).

I work on political economy, money in politics, and corruption. I am especially interested in how extremely wealthy businesspeople (oligarchs) interact with politicians, political institutions, and the public to shape important political and policy outcomes in weakly institutionalized states. In my research, I draw heavily from the contemporary experience of Ukraine and other post-communist states, and utilize a variety of data collection and data analysis methods, including social network analysis, surveys and survey experiments, automated data collection techniques, and qualitative interviews.

I hold a Master's degree in Global Studies from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/), a Master's degree in Political Science from [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en), and a Bachelor's degree in European Studies from [Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski"](https://www.uni-sofia.bg/index.php/bul). My research has been supported by [The Rotary Foundation](https://www.rotary.org/en/our-programs/peace-fellowships?gclid=CjwKCAjwjOunBhB4EiwA94JWsHRVl6Vf-xC2qs7aLQw4613ZQUT1oG-1ERtE7Q4ih2YfZXogzKIgcRoCMM8QAvD_BwE), the [Institute for Humane Studies](https://www.theihs.org/), and the [Smith Richardson Foundation](https://www.srf.org/), among others.
